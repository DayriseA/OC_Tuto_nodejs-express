# OC class to discover Node.js and Express

Simple OpenClassrooms course to help you apply your JavaScript knowledge to back-end technologies (Node, Express, and MongoDB) in order to create complete servers that can interact with databases.
(Use a provided frontend that's not part of this repository).

## Objectives

- Create a Node server and use it to serve an Express application.
- Connect your application to a MongoDB database and, using Mongoose, create a RESTful API that allows CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete).
- Implement secure authentication based on the JWT token.
- Implement file upload management, allowing users to add and remove images.
